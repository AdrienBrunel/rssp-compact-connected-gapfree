# reserve_spatial_constraints
This code solves a mixed-integer linear program that explicitly designs compact, connected and gap-free reserves within the reserve site selection problem.

# Connected, compact and gap-free reserves
This code is developed alongside the published work "Brunel, A., Omer, J., Gicquel, A. & Lanco, S. **Designing compact, connected and gap-free reserves with systematic reserve site selection models**. _Applied Mathematical Modelling (2024)_. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2024.06.001". 

# General information
1. If this is the first time the code run on your computer, you have to install manually the packages loaded in load_path_pkg.jl.  

2. Julia version for this code is 1.4.2
